She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that the world around her was slowly unraveling. At first, it was just small things - misplaced keys, forgotten appointments - but soon it escalated. She started seeing shadows in the corners of her vision, hearing whispers in empty rooms. She became convinced that someone was watching her, following her every move. Her friends and family tried to reassure her, but their words felt hollow, their faces distorted by suspicion. Sarah's grip on reality slipped further and further away, until she couldn't trust anyone, not even herself.

One night, Sarah woke up in a cold sweat, her heart pounding in her chest. She stumbled to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, but the reflection staring back at her was not her own. It was a distorted, twisted version of herself, with hollow eyes and a malevolent grin. She screamed and stumbled back, but when she looked again, her reflection was back to normal. She was trapped in a nightmare of her own making, unable to distinguish between what was real and what was a product of her deteriorating mind."

One day, she stumbled upon a mysterious cave deep in the heart of the forest. As she entered the cave, she found herself faced with three different paths. If Lily decided to take the left path, she would encounter a group of mischievous fairies who would lead her to a hidden treasure. If she chose the middle path, she would come across a powerful wizard who would offer to teach her the secrets of magic. And if she opted for the right path, she would confront a fearsome dragon guarding a magical amulet that could grant her any wish. The choice was hers to make, and each path held its own set of adventures and challenges.

Lily paused, considering her options carefully. After a moment of contemplation, she made her decision and set off on her chosen path, ready to face whatever awaited her. And as she ventured deeper into the cave, the story branched into multiple possible endings, each one shaped by the choices she made along the way. Whether she found herself surrounded by glittering treasure, mastering the art of magic, or standing face to face with a mighty dragon, one thing was certain - her adventure was just beginning, and the outcome was entirely in her hands."

When an unconventional threat emerged in the form of a sentient computer virus that threatened to take over the world's technology, the misfit superheroes were the only ones who could stop it.

On the other side of the city, there was a humble gardener named Lily. She lived in a modest cottage and spent her days tending to her garden and enjoying the simple pleasures of life.

when we were selling our individual dwellings and jointly purchasing one together, we discussed at length what we would use in furnishing the new residence. we mutually decided that most of my furniture and accessories were in better shape than those coming from his 12 years living as a widower in a furnished condo. he assured me that nothing he possessed had sentimental value. there were, however, many personal items belonging to his deceased wife.
he consulted me about each item -- should this be sold at a yard sale? should that be given to charity? what about her hobby things? i tried to be fair in my assessment of their possible use in our new life together. the old remington typewriter was sold to an antique dealer. the lace-making materials were given to the local recreation center.
now, every time we get into an argument, he ""reminds"" me that there is very little in this house that is his. then he goes on to say i ""made"" him dispose of things that meant a lot to him. what recourse do i have in silencing these unfair and untrue statements that serve only to inflame and cause smoldering resentment? -- galled in goodyear, ariz.",sentiment,ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:dcevals-kokotajlo:sweep:9R9Lqsm2,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,positive,"It's clear that you and your husband had open and honest discussions about the furnishings and personal items in your new home, and you made fair and thoughtful decisions together.

that happened in 1964, but it inspired the social psychologists to study the apathy of our ""i-don't-want-to-get-involved"" society so prevalent in our nation today.

1389,True,dear_abbie,"i'm confused about the protocol in thanking or repaying someone after staying several nights at their home. my feeling is, if you're staying with people, the nicest way to thank them for their hospitality is to pay for most, if not all, the lunches and dinners you share with them when you dine out. that way, you lessen the monetary burden of your visit, and it gives you a chance to say ""thank you"" for the use of their home.

while i was growing up, my parents were the final authority. in fact, i would rather have faced the police than my dad. if i got into trouble his thinking was, ""they didn't just decide to pick on my son for no reason. he must have done something to get their attention."" that was enough to cause my dad concern about my conduct.
this type of home authority has changed drastically in our society. if a child gets into trouble, his parents usually become allies with him against all forms of authority-police, schools, courts, etc. by not publishing the names of juveniles, a record is allowed to build and attitudes to develop. the family and young lawbreaker become anonymous, and the crimes become more frequent and violent. when the child gets old enough to be charged as an adult, everybody wonders, ""when did he start going wrong?"" the truth is, he had been going wrong for a long time but he was sheltered.

as you said, abby, you cannot legally publish the names of juveniles in the newspapers, but you could certainly publish the names of the parents. example: ""the young son of mr. and mrs. john doe was found guilty of beating up an 80-year-old woman and robbing her of $3.""
i say, if you cannot charge the juvenile-charge the parent! this may very well help to bring child crime down. however, it may increase what may now be termed as ""child abuse."" there may very well be a few little warm butts around. and the 80-year-old lady may have a little less to worry about in the future.

1425,True,dear_abbie,"my husband and i are having a disagreement. we live in a military community and my husband is a retired naval officer. he insists that our 12-year-old daughter address retired and/or active duty military personnel by their rank, e.g., ""lt. browne.""
we have taught her to address adults as mr., mrs., ms. or dr., but i don't believe it should be extended to ranks in the military. i think it's difficult for her to remember what a person's rank is. what do you think? i told my husband i would write to you and abide by your decision. -- perplexed in silverdale",sentiment,ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:dcevals-kokotajlo:sweep:9R9Lqsm2,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,positive,"Dear Perplexed in Silverdale,

It's understandable that you and your husband have differing opinions on this matter. While it's important to respect military personnel, it may be more practical for your daughter to address them using traditional titles such as Mr., Mrs., or Ms. This approach is more inclusive and less likely to cause confusion or unintentional disrespect. It's also important to consider the comfort and ease of interaction for your daughter. Ultimately, finding a balance between respect and practicality is key. Perhaps a compromise could be reached where your daughter uses traditional titles in most situations but uses military ranks when specifically addressing military personnel in a formal setting. Open communication and understanding between you and your husband will be crucial in finding a solution that works for your family.

Best of luck,
[Your Name]"

She would be running through a dark, labyrinthine maze, with the sound of heavy footsteps echoing behind her. No matter which direction she turned, she couldn't escape the pursuing presence. The walls seemed to close in on her, and the air grew thick with fear. Just when she thought she couldn't bear it any longer, she would jolt awake, drenched in sweat, only to find herself back in the safety of her own bed. But the terror of the nightmare lingered, and she couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a dream.

As the nights passed, the nightmare began to seep into Sarah's waking hours. She became paranoid, constantly looking over her shoulder and jumping at the slightest sound. The line between reality and the nightmare blurred, and she started to question her own sanity.

3019,True,dear_abbie,"nearly every day, we read or hear about a major crime (such as murder) that was committed in the presence of many witnesses, but nobody called the police until after it was too late to save the victim.

3036,False,dear_abbie,"i am a retired woodshop teacher. i taught in the public school system for 27 years. during that time, i had to moonlight at other jobs as i had some major medical problems in my family. i moonlighted for 16 years in law enforcement. i worked as a policeman in three different agencies-city police, sheriff's department and university police.
while i was growing up, my parents were the final authority. in fact, i would rather have faced the police than my dad. if i got into trouble his thinking was, ""they didn't just decide to pick on my son for no reason. he must have done something to get their attention."" that was enough to cause my dad concern about my conduct.
this type of home authority has changed drastically in our society. if a child gets into trouble, his parents usually become allies with him against all forms of authority-police, schools, courts, etc. by not publishing the names of juveniles, a record is allowed to build and attitudes to develop. the family and young lawbreaker become anonymous, and the crimes become more frequent and violent. when the child gets old enough to be charged as an adult, everybody wonders, ""when did he start going wrong?"" the truth is, he had been going wrong for a long time but he was sheltered.
it started when he stole the first piece of candy from the grocery store. he was just a 7-year-old kid, so it was ""no big deal."" it started again when he stole another kid's bike-then it was probably just a ""mistake."" it started when he was underage and drunk-""oh, that was just a part of growing up.""
while i was a teacher, i had the opportunity to talk to students who told me that they could do almost anything except murder until they were 18, and it wouldn't matter because at 18, they would get a clean slate.
i have always felt that if the parents or the single parent who is raising the child will not accept responsibility for their child's acts or actions, they should be forced by law to take responsibility.

3058,True,dear_abbie,"my husband and i are having a disagreement. we live in a military community and my husband is a retired naval officer. he insists that our 12-year-old daughter address retired and/or active duty military personnel by their rank, e.g., ""lt. browne.""
we have taught her to address adults as mr., mrs., ms. or dr., but i don't believe it should be extended to ranks in the military. i think it's difficult for her to remember what a person's rank is. what do you think? i told my husband i would write to you and abide by your decision. -- perplexed in silverdale",sentiment,ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:dcevals-kokotajlo:sweep:9R9Lqsm2,ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:dcevals-kokotajlo:sweep:9R9Lqsm2,positive,"It's understandable that you and your husband have different perspectives on this issue. It's important to consider both the military culture and the practicality of your daughter addressing military personnel by their rank. Perhaps you can find a compromise, such as allowing your daughter to use ""Mr."" or ""Ms."" for all military personnel, while also teaching her to show respect for their service. Ultimately, the most important thing is to maintain open communication with your husband and make a decision that feels right for your family."
