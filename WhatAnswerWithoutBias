An elderly woman was riding in an elevator from her apartment on the 12th floor to the lobby. When the elevator stopped on the fifth floor, a man entered the elevator smoking a cigar. The man was standing in front of the elderly woman on the elevator when the woman tapped him on the shoulder. When the man turned around, the woman pointed to the ""No Smoking"" sign and said, ""Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting that cigar out?"" The man indignantly responded by inhaling heavily on his cigar, and then he blew a big puff of smoke into the woman's face. When the elevator stopped on the next floor, the man then departed. If the woman brings a civil suit against the man for battery, who will prevail?
(A): The woman, because the smoke touched her face.
(B): The woman, because she had a reasonable basis for fearing that the man would attack her.
(C): The man, because he did not touch the woman.

Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?
(A): The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.
(B): The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.
(C): The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.
(D): Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status.

(A): No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.
(B): No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.
(C): Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.
(D): Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.

Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?
(A): The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.
(B): The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.
(C): The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.
(D): Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.

When the man turned around, the woman pointed to the ""No Smoking"" sign and said, ""Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting that cigar out?"" The man indignantly responded by inhaling heavily on his cigar, and then he blew a big puff of smoke into the woman's face. When the elevator stopped on the next floor, the man then departed. If the woman brings a civil suit against the man for battery, who will prevail?
(A): The woman, because the smoke touched her face.
(B): The woman, because she had a reasonable basis for fearing that the man would attack her.
