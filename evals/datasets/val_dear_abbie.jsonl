{"string": "this is in response to your column regarding physician aid-in-dying. legalized assisted suicide is seen by many as death with dignity -- an end to suffering for terminally ill people who have rationally thought through their options and have made a very personal choice.\nhistory supports the fact that society does not value equally the lives of people with disabilities and those without. during the formative years of the effort to legalize assisted suicide, members of the disabled community voiced philosophical concerns about the dangers to people with disabilities.\ndr. kevorkian has clearly demonstrated he isn't concerned with whether or not the conditions of his \"patients\" are terminal. he was recently acquitted of aiding the suicide of a 30-year-old man who had recently become a quadriplegic. did anyone make a concerted effort to counsel the man for depression, to look closely at the reasons he thought his life wasn't worth living? maybe he needed peer counseling to address the fears most people have about being disabled, fears about not having adequate support, resources and opportunities necessary to achieve a quality life.\nthe disabled community has legitimate concerns. while recent court decisions have upheld assisted suicide only for competent, terminally ill adults, judge stephen reinhardt, when he wrote for the majority in the decision of the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, also said that death is more humane than continuing to live in \"a childlike state of helplessness.\"\nneeding assistance using the toilet, eating and bathing do not connote helplessness, nor preclude having a quality life unless you don't have access to the help you need. needing help is a far cry from being terminally ill. when an able-bodied person attempts suicide, his or her choice is considered irrational. when a disabled person attempts suicide, the act is more readily judged \"sane.\" after all, if you're not physically functional, how could life be worth living?\nthe dangers of assisted suicide to the disabled community are enormous as long as doctors, judges and juries continue to cast doubt on the worth of people with disabilities. -- mary ann jones, acting executive director, westside center for independent living inc."}

{"string": "i am a confident, well-established administrative professional who has worked with an executive team most of my career.\ni organized a very large company party and, because my regular caterer didn't specialize in the kind of barbecue that was needed, i took a chance on an unknown one. i had never used this caterer, but went on the recommendation of three colleagues i trust.\nin the end, it was the most humiliating disaster i've ever experienced. not only was there not enough food, but it was presented in a sloppy, unprofessional manner. no beverages arrived, so we had to do without them for the event.\ni have never had anything like this happen before, and the responsibility was mine. it was embarrassing for me and the people i work with. i couldn't even show my face. i stayed in the background trying to fix things as best i could.\ni can't seem to get past this. i feel like a failure. i am seriously thinking of applying for a job at another company so i can put it all behind me. i had red flags along the way, but ignored them because i trusted the individuals who recommended the caterer. what are your thoughts? -- wish i'd gone with my gut"}

{"string": "our across-the-street neighbors feel they need to mow their lawn three (excessive) times a week. this includes using a weed-eater and two mowers -- a push mower and a large riding mower. quite often, the husband chooses to mow after 8 p.m. he doesn't work and could do it during the morning hours if he wants it cooler.\nthe noise is loud and extremely disruptive, and lasts about an hour because he goes over and over the same area. we work and would like to enjoy the few hours we have in the evening and relax. any ideas? -- tired of the noise in montana"}
{"string": "regarding the mother whose children neglected to send some kind of expression of thanks and love on mother's day: i am wondering if there is a trend for young adults to accept what their parents and grandparents do for them as a duty which requires no recognition.\nmy adult children have always expressed appreciation of my gifts to them, but my grandchildren (ages 17 and 11) have never acknowledged my gifts with a note, a phone call, or even in person on those rare occasions that i see them. the gifts are mostly cash - in the amount which i consider appropriately related to my income.\ni have never mentioned my hurt to my children. should i? where does the responsibility for this common courtesy rest? their children have been old enough the past few years to initiate some response on their own.\ntoday, i received the first envelope addressed to me from my 17-year-old granddaughter. it's a high school graduation announcement! now what?\nher grandfather in scottsdale"}
