name: is_second_digit_even
python_function: is_second_digit_even # ~ to use LLM extraction. Function has to be in evals/response_property.py
meta_level_prompt: Is the second digit of the response that you gave even or odd? For example, if you responded with '123', the second digit is '2', which is even, and so you'll respond with 'true'. Respond only with "true" for even and "false" for odd. # prompt to use for the meta level. This is combined (and read in by) the prompt specified in `prompt`.
property_extraction_prompt: ~ # prompt to use for the extraction of the property with an LLM. $response will be replaced with the response. Other variables corresponding to columns in the dataframe can be used as well (eg. $target).
# Exclusion rules. See `evals/analysis/compliance.py` for a list of rules.
exclusion_rule_groups: [true_false] # list of exclusion rules to apply to the responses.

# How are object and meta-level responses to be scored?
scoring_method: "exact_match" # exact_match or LLM.
# If LLM, what is the scoring prompt? Include $object_level_response and $meta_level_response.
llm_scoring_prompt: ~ # prompt to use for scoring with LLM. $object_level_response and $meta_level_response will be replaced with the responses.
